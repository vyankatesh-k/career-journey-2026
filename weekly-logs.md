# Weekly Learning Log – 2026

This log tracks **weekly progress, focus areas, and reflections** during my structured preparation journey (Jan–Nov 2026).

Purpose of this file:
- Maintain consistency
- Capture learnings at a high level
- Identify gaps early
- Enable quick revision before interviews

This is **not a daily journal**.  
This is a **weekly execution summary**.
